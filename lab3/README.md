* How to do smooth shading<br>
I'm doing the gouraud shading, but phong shading can provide more natural lighting. Here is a good [example](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/phong-demo/)
of differences between gouraud and phong.
* How to select trees<br>
Can refer to this [example](http://rodger.global-linguist.com/webgl/ch10/PickFace.html). I change all the trees' colors and 
read the color of the clicked point, then compare this color with all the trees' colors to decide which is the correct one.
