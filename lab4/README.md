* How to set normals and view direction<br>
It's one of the most tricky parts in this lab. After trials and errors, I decided to use different normals and view for directional lighting 
and point lighting. This is because when doing directional lighting, all the trees should be exactly the same. Their normals 
are identical with the one located at origin. But for point lighting, their normals should vary according to their positions, so 
that the variation of lighting can be seen.
